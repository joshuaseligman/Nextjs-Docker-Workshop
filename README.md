# Nextjs-Docker-Workshop

This repository contains the workshop I presented for Marist College Computer Society. The objective of the workshop was to teach our members basic web development with Next.js and to gain an understanding of Docker and how it can be used for deploying web servers.

To get started, begin by installing Node.js and Docker.

Node.js can be found at the following link: https://nodejs.org/en/

Docker can be found at the following link: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop <br>
Windows users, be sure to read the documentation first as the install process is a little different than Mac and Linux: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/

Once everything is installed, proceed to the `workshop.md` file for all the instructions on how to build your first Next.js application and your first Docker container.
